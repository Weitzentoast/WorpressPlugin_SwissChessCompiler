# WorpressPlugin_SwissChessCompiler
This Rep. will be a Wordpress Plugin.

Problem: Swiss Chess!
If you would done a RL Tournament.Then Swiss Chess is one of the top used programms for the case.
It's not free but often in use, because of his big market gab.
Just as a Info: The html files Swiss Chess created can provide sometimes not the full Name or Data Set!
I would be personaly be more a fan of writting a Programm for this but I also don't want to be the Person you get mad on if something goes wrong.

Or it turns out that an unwanted feature was built in, we all now this could haben :-( Sad but relatic I belive.

Idee of the solution:
So in the Case it would be a Plugin. For Updloading the .... html files from Swiss Chess to first in CheckLayout and then in a database.
Maybe I also will try to use the Plugin for Tournament Registration and also implementing the API to get player Data from the german chess association.
For notice this is firstly an idea and will be first implementenet. If the base programm is working.

The Base Plugin would be first written on the Example of the German HTML file first and later it also gets a template for English (US).
The Plugin itself will get a dictionary where all of the needed language can be filled in with another language.

The code and all comments are written in English. If this should not be the case, I would appreciate a hint.
It will probably be German if you want to translate it :-), but if you remind me I would fix it.
Also if any you had a better way to describe to function, class or etc. you now what to do.

I know the programming style is not the standard, but I'm open to any suggestion to talk.
So I hope this projekt could maybe safe you some time and that Swiss Chess is not including a own posibility to upload the data to freely selectable API.

For Changes on the program (Infos and Important Stuff for Editing):

- all you can change is written in a class Config. In this is all important stuff declared.
- if you want to change the Name of the BaseDirectory you   should need to change also the const PROJEKT_NAME to the new directory name.
